Just completed Intermediate Level -Task 4 at LGMVIP Internship! I've successfully created a Todo List web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This dynamic and user-friendly application allows users to manage their tasks effectively. Here's an overview of the features:

Explained Features:

Task Addition: Users can add new tasks to the list by entering task details in the input field and clicking the "+" button.
Real-Time Date and Time Display: The current date and time are displayed dynamically on the webpage, providing users with up-to-date information.
Checkbox and Strikethrough: Each task includes a checkbox. When checked, the task text is visually marked with a strikethrough, indicating completion.
Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks by clicking on the trash icon associated with each task.
Move Task to Completed Section: Checked tasks are automatically moved to the "Completed Tasks" section for better organization.
Show/Hide Completed Tasks: Users can toggle between showing and hiding the completed tasks section, providing flexibility in managing their view.
Clear All Tasks: A button is available to clear all tasks from both the active tasks and completed tasks sections.
